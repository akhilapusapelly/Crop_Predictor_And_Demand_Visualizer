# Crop_Predictor_And_Demand_Visualizer
This is a simple Machine Learning model which predicts the crop based on the values such as N, P, K, Temperature, Humidity, PH, Rainfall, Soil_type, Season, Budget_per_Hecture. Also, it gives a visualization chart depicting the crops grown by the other farmers in order to show which is the least grown crop.

Tkinter is used to build the interface.

Machine Learning algorithm used: Logistic Regression
Libraries used: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib
